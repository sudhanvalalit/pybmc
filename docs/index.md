# pyBMC Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for pyBMC, a Python package for general Bayesian Model Combination (BMC).

## Overview

pyBMC provides a comprehensive framework for combining multiple predictive models using Bayesian statistics. Key features include:

- **Data Management**: Load and preprocess various types of data from HDF5 and CSV files
- **Orthogonalization**: Transform model predictions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Bayesian Inference**: Perform Gibbs sampling for model combination
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Generate predictions with credible intervals
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculate coverage statistics for model validation

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install pybmc
```

### Quick Start
