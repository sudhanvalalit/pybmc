# pyBMC: A General Bayesian Model Combination Package

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Coverage-82%25-brightgreen)](https://ascsn.github.io/pybmc/coverage/)

pyBMC is a Python package for performing Bayesian Model Combination (BMC) on various predictive models. It provides tools for data handling, orthogonalization, Gibbs sampling, and prediction with uncertainty quantification.

## Features

- **Data Management**: Load and preprocess nuclear mass data from HDF5 and CSV files
- **Orthogonalization**: Transform model predictions using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Bayesian Inference**: Perform Gibbs sampling for model combination
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Generate predictions with credible intervals
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculate coverage statistics for model validation

## Installation

```bash
pip install pybmc
```

## Quick Start
